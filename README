Small library to add DataMapper style resources for MongoDB.

class ExampleResource
  include Mordor::Resource

  attribute :first
  attribute :second
  attribute :third, :finder_method => :find_by_third_attribute
end

This adds attr_accessors to the ExampleResource for each attribute, plus adds finder methods of the form 
find_by_{attribute}. The naming convention can be overridden by using the optional :finder_method option,
as can be seen with the third attribute.
